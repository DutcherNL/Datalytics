A high CO2 concentration has been detected for extended duration. Ideally, humidity remains below 1000ppm. However between {{ dt_start }} and {{ dt_last_update }} an average concentration of {{ avg_value }}ppm has been detected.

## What can cause it?
Many people in a crowded badly ventilated space or excessive use of CO2 expelling sources (such as a stove) can cause CO2 concentrations to increase. Extended exposure to high CO2 concentrations have been linked to reduced awareness and a feeling of drowsiness. Exposure to really high values over 5000 ppm can lead to serious health risks.

## What can I do about it right away?
Ensure that the room is well ventilated, either through outside air or with other spaces in the home. Open windows and doors or turn on mechanical ventilation{% if room.type == COOK %}, such as an exhaust hood, {% endif %} on.

## What can I do about it on the long term?
Does the problem prevail? Consider installing a mechanical ventilation system that (automatically) ventilates the space when high CO2 values are detected. Also consider, if possible, installing windows that can open more if current options in opening windows are limited.

Though plants and shrubbery do extract CO2 from the air, the speed and quantity is unnoticably low, so a few plants on their own wonâ€™t suffice.  Plants do however have  good moisture regulating effects and also curb heat in a room a bit.

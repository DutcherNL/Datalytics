You have exceeded the maximum temperature. Overall we have measured {{ msg.avg_value }}. Which is higher than the expected value.
This has been lasting for {{ msg.duration }} ticks.

## What could cause it?




## What can I do about it now?
If the external temperature is higher than it is indoors, make sure the windows are closed so no more heat
enters from outside. If you have blinds you can close them on the sunny side of the house to prevent as much
heat from solar rays entering the house. If you have an external solar screen, lowering is highly advised.

During warmer periods it is advised to close windows when external temperature exceeds the outside temperature and
opening them back up when the external temperature is lower than the internal temperature. As a rule of thumb: On 
warm afternoons the flow must stop. But when the bright sun sets, you open them up. Make sure you open as many windows
as possible to assure the house takes in as much of the cooler air as possible.

## What can I do about it later?
Does the problem occur more often? Insulating your home helps the heat from coming in. Though in summer one of the
biggest contributors of heating up a home is direct heat from the sun. One can feel this by touching the window on 
warm sunny days. It feels warmer than the air. As such reducing direct sunlight entering through the window is 
a good way to reduce the indoor temperature. This can be done by installing a solar screen or blinds on the exterior
of the building and loweing them on warm days when the sun is shining on the surfaces.

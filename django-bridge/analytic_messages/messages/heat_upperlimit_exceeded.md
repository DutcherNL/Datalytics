# Maximum temperature exceeded
You have exceeded the maximum temperature. Overall we have measured {{ msg.avg_value }}. Which is higher than the expected value.
This has been lasting for {{ msg.duration }} ticks.

## What could cause it?
A high indoor temperature is often caused by heat from outside coming in. This can be through warm air, but also 
through solar radiation by the sun shining through windows or on your walls.

## What can I do about it now?
If the external temperature is higher than it is indoors, make sure the windows are closed so no more warm air
enters from outside. During warmer periods it is advised to close windows when external temperature exceeds
the outside temperature and
opening them back up when the external temperature is lower than the internal temperature. As a rule of thumb: On 
warm afternoons the flow must stop. But when the bright sun sets, you open them up. Make sure you open as many windows
as possible to assure the house takes in as much of the cooler air as possible.

You can also try to lower the heat emitted from the sun entering the house. If there any windows that currently
receive direct sunlight, try closing the blinds or, when present, solar screen to reduce direct sunlight entering
your home.

## What can I do about it later?
Does the problem occur more often? Insulating your home helps the heat from coming in through the walls and windows.
Particularly when you have single glass (which can be the case on older homes).

The biggest contributer for high temperatures in summer is the sun. Direct sunlight can raise local temperatures
higher than the direct air temperature. This is particularly the case for direct sunlight. Installing a solar screen on
south or west facing windows allow you to limit the rays entering your home reducing indoor temperature.

It is also possible to reduce indoor temperature by installing exterior vegetation. Either because it shades part of
your home (as is the case with a tree) or because it absorbs some of the heat through water evaporation (as is 
the case for vines growing along a wall or mossy vegetations on a flat roof).

## What can cause it?
A high indoor temperature is often the result of external energy entering the home. Either because hot air from the outside being ventilated into the home or because direct sunlight enters and heats up the home. Hot external walls can also ensure a steady flow of heat entering the home.

## What can I do about it right away?
When the outside air temperature is higher than the internal air temperature it is recommanded to keep windows closed. This can ensure that cool air remains in the home and hot air stays outside. During hot periods such as in the peak of summer it is recommanded to keep windows and doors closed during the day. During the night when the sun is down and the outside air is cooler, it is recommanded to open the windows and doors to ventilate the home and allowing the hotter air inside to be exchanged  with the cooler air outside.

During the day it is also recommanded to reduce direct sunlight in the home. If there are any windows receiving direct sunlight, make sure to close curtains or blinds at that side of the home to reduce the heat from solar radiation entering the living space.

## What can I do about it on the long term?
Does the problem prevail? Insulating the home can help reduce heat from entering through walls or glass windows. Do you still use single glass windows? (This can be the case at older residences) Replace them with double glazing or better as soon as possible.

The biggest cause of heat in homes in summer is the sun. Direct sunlight can heat up spaces higher than the external air temperature. Installing solar blinds at the south or west side of your home can severely reduce direct sunlight when the blinds are lowered. Reducing internal temperature and increasing comfort.

It’s also possible to reduce internal temperature by placing trees and shrubbery outside of your home. The shadow of a tree blocks the sun reducing temperatures of walls and windows. Plants such as ivy or green roofs containing mossy shrubbery can also have positive effects in reducing the temperature; plants themselves have a heat regulating process and shall evaporate water during hotter days. Due take into account to water these plants sufficiently during these times.
Plants inside the home can also have a small temperature buffering effect, though it is relatively small when you have only one or two plants.

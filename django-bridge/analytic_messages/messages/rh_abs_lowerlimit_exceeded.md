A low moisture content has been detected for extended duration. A humidity level lower than 6g/kg can pose serious health risks. However between {{ dt_start }} and {{ dt_last_update }} an average moisture content of {{ avg_value }}g/kg has been detected.

## What can cause it?
Low moisture content can be caused by a high ventilation in winter. The maximum absolute humidity – in other words the amount of water molecules in the air – is lower in colder air compared to warm air. In other words, when it is cold outside, the outside air can have a lot less water molecules in it. When ventilating that air, similarly to losing indoor heat, you also lose indoor water vapour.

Extremely low moisture content can lead to a higher risk of serious consequences when faced with influenza.

## What can I do about it right away?
Ensure that there are sources for water vapour present in the room, or reduce the amount of ventilation with the outside air. It can also be beneficial to have some water vapour buffering materials in the room. Plants for instance are well known to have some humidity regulatory effects, allowing for the water vapour to be buffered. Similarly wood can also, even when  used in furniture, have that effect. Though coatings such as paint can reduce its effectivity.

## What can I do about it on the long term?
Does the problem prevail? Consider buying a humidifier. Humidifiers are devices that insert water vapour in the air. There are portable humidifiers availlable, but it’s also possible to install humidifiers in a ventilation system if one is present in the room.

A high humidity has been detected for extended duration. Ideally, humidity remains below 60%. However between {{ dt_start }} and {{ dt_last_update }} an average humidity of {{ avg_value }}% has been detected.

## What can cause it?
High humidity can be caused by insufficient vantilation of a space with sources of high watervapour. For instance a kitchen in which water is boiled or during a shower. People are also a source of watervapour, though there need to be multiple people in the room for an extended duration for any noteable effect to occur.

The problem of a high long lasting humidity is the forming of mold on walls and ceilings. Mold can also occur on more hard to reach places such as underneath or on top of cabinets and other nooks and crannies in a space where moisture can build up. For mold to grow, there needs to be an extended high humidity for longer durations. Higher temperatures can increase the rate of mold-growth, but are not a neccessity.

When mold is present in a room, humans can experience negative respiratory effects or other health-adverse effects. The extense of these effects depend on the type of mold grown. In most cases this wonâ€™t result in serious consequences, though it will be undesirable.

## What can I do about it right away?
Make sure that the space is well ventilated by opening windows or doors. In case mechanical ventilation is available, make sure it is on when sources of watervapour are active.

## What can I do about it on the long term?
Does the problem prevail? Make sure there are more options for natural ventilation of the air.  Ideally the space should allow ventilation to at least two different spaces, for instance the outside and a hallway. Differences in air pressure can result in natural ventilation to occur. This in turn allows the humidity in the room to level out with other (larger) areas, reducing the humidity. Therefore it advised to make sure there is enough of an opening to a different space for air to pass. For instance by installing a ventilation grate in the window. Or having an opening below the door where air can go through. In case the door to the {{ room.name }} seals of well, consider installing a grill in the door to the {{ room.name }} and the adjecent space.

You can also consider, if one is not yet present, to install mechanical ventilation. Mechanical ventilation ensures a higher ventilation rate than natural ventilation, thus reducing the water vapour accumulation in the room. Do note that this costs more and takes up more space to install.

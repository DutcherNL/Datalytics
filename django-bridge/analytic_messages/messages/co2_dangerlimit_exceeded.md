An extremely high CO2 concentration of over 5000ppm has been detected between {{ dt_start }} and {{ dt_last_update }}. Exposed duration can cause serious health effects. {% if is_active %} Open windows and doors and vacate the space until tolerable levels have returned! {% endif %}

## What can cause it?
Many people in a crowded badly ventilated space or excessive use of CO2 expelling sources (such as a stove) can cause CO2 concentrations to increase. Extended exposure to high CO2 concentrations have been linked to reduced awareness, reduced brain capacity and can, with continued exposure to values above 5000ppm, cause lasting health effects.

## What can I do about it right away?
Ensure that the room is well ventilated, either through outside air Open windows and doors or turn on mechanical ventilation{% if room.type == COOK %}, such as an exhaust hood, {% endif %} on.

## What can I do about it on the long term?
Does the problem prevail? Consider installing a mechanical ventilation system that (automatically) ventilates the space when high CO2 values are detected. Also consider, if possible, installing windows that can open more if current options in opening windows are limited.

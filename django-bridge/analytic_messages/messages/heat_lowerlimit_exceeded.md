The minimum recommanded temperature of 16°C has been exceeded between {{ dt_start }} and {{ dt_last_update }}. On average a temperature of {{ avg_value }}°C has been detected.

## What can cause it?
It is caused by the outside air being significantly below 16°C. Either this air is heavily ventilated through the home or the home is badly insulated causing a lot of the indoor heat to leak to the outside air.

## What can I do about it right away?
Making sure that most windows and doors are closed, letting through only minimum amounts of air to ensure fresh ventilated air. Make sure that the heating system in your home is active. Depending on the space and the way the house is heated (floor heating, radiator), it could take a while before the space is actively being heated.

## What can I do about it on the long term?
Does the problem prevail? Insulating the home can help reduce heat from escaping through walls or glass windows. Do you still use single glass windows? (This can be the case at older residences) Replace them with double glazing or better as soon as possible. 

Is the home well insulated, yet is the room still not heating up properly? There could be a problem with your heating system. Call a local mechanic to take a look at your system. Due note that systems such as floor or wall heating along with a heat-pump can take a long time to heat up a room. Ensure these systems are activated timely by having them trigger activation on a higher temperature.

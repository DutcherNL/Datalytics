A light intensity (illuminance) in the workplace has been detected below 500lux. Between {{ dt_start }} and {{ dt_last_update }} an average value of {{ avg_value }} has been detected.

## What can cause it?
When insufficient light from outside enters the room, light inside the room need to be turned on in order to increase the light intensity in the work environment.
Light on the desk level below 500lx can lead to a reduced concentration. In some visually detailed work (such as stitching, or drawing), it can also lead to additional eye strain resulting in an earlier onset tiredness.

## What can I do about it right away?
Turn on additional lights. If a des klight is present it could be wise to turn it on. A localized focussed desk light can increase illuminance on the work desk.

## What can I do about it on the long term?
If lights in the room are not sufficient, consider buying additional lights. A desk light in particular can help in this situation, providing a more localised source of lighting on the place where it is needed.
